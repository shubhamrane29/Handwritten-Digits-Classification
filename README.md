# Handwritten Digits Classification
This simple project demonstrates multiple strategies to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow. Three distinct methods are showcased:

- Model without Hidden Layers: Implementing a straightforward model without incorporating any hidden layers in the neural network.
- Model with Single Hidden Layer: Employing a neural network model with a single hidden layer for improved classification.
- TensorFlow's Flattening Function: Showcasing TensorFlow's in-built flattening function for efficient data preprocessing in classification tasks.
- Additionally, the project integrates the use of a confusion matrix to assess the classification performance after each model's execution.
